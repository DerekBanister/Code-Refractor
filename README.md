# Code-Refractor

// First Change, fixing search engine optimization button. <a> tag was not defined as "href"

// Deleted Line 35, unecessary line of code that made no changes to the website when deleted

// Gave the <p> tags a class = "font" for easier readability in style.css and so that every paragraph would have the same font and be semantically correct.

//Line 40 in CSS and lines 16, 19, and 22, the tag was just a. I gave all the <a> tags a class that is "color". I am not sure if this is correct as it serves the same function, but figured just the a tag in css was not correct as only the <a> and <p> tags had standalone css with no class.
